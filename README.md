# Insure landing page

For this project I recreated this website from a mockup. I utlized my skills of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make a pixel perfect clone of the original design.
In this project I continued to learn the importance if responsive design. From image resizing, hidding and showing buttons, and changing fonts to make the user experience all the more pleasent on any device or viewport size.
